# Give me the top 10 Python interview questions with answers?

You can include code samples as well.

Here are the top 10 Python interview questions with concise answers and code examples where applicable:

### 1. What is Python? What are its key features?

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its simple, readable syntax. Key features include dynamic typing, automatic memory management, extensive libraries, and support for multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural, and functional)[^1_1].

### 2. How does Python handle memory management?

Python uses **automatic memory management** with a built-in garbage collector. Memory is allocated and deallocated automatically as objects are created and destroyed. Reference counting and cyclic garbage collection are employed to manage and free memory efficiently[^1_1].

### 3. What is the difference between a Python list and a tuple?

- **List**: Mutable, can be changed after creation. Syntax: `[^1_2][^1_3][^1_4]`
- **Tuple**: Immutable, cannot be changed after creation. Syntax: `(1, 2, 3)`

Example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_list[^1_0] = 4  # Valid
# my_tuple[^1_0] = 4  # Raises TypeError
```


### 4. What is the purpose of the `__init__` method in Python classes?

`__init__` is the constructor method that initializes a new class instance's attributes when the object is created.

Example:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
d = Dog("Buddy")
```


### 5. What are *args and **kwargs?

- `*args` allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments.
- `**kwargs` allows any number of keyword arguments.

Example:

```python
def demo(*args, **kwargs):
    print(args)
    print(kwargs)
demo(1, 2, three=3, four=4)
# Output: (1, 2), {'three': 3, 'four': 4}
```


### 6. What are list comprehensions? Give an example.

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists using a single line of code.

Example:

```python
squares = [x*x for x in range(6)]
# Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```


### 7. What is a Python decorator?

A decorator is a function that modifies the behavior of another function without changing its code, usually prefixed with `@`.

Example:

```python
def decorator_func(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function call")
        func()
        print("After function call")
    return wrapper

@decorator_func
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")
say_hello()
```


### 8. What is a generator? How is it different from a regular function?

A generator is a function that returns an iterator which yields one value at a time, using the `yield` statement. Generators don’t store all values in memory, making them memory efficient.

Example:

```python
def count_up_to(n):
    count = 1
    while count <= n:
        yield count
        count += 1
```


### 9. How do you handle exceptions in Python?

You use `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to handle exceptions.

Example:

```python
try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
finally:
    print("Execution complete")
```


### 10. What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?

- **Shallow copy:** Copies reference to objects only. Changes to nested objects affect both copies.
- **Deep copy:** Copies everything recursively. Changes in nested objects do not affect the original.

Example:

```python
import copy
lst1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
lst2 = copy.copy(lst1)    # Shallow copy
lst3 = copy.deepcopy(lst1) # Deep copy
```

These questions and answers cover concepts commonly tested in Python interviews for 2025, offering both theory and practical code illustrations.
